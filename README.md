# I-one Documentation


## Getting started


I-one provides the tools to visualize and analyze images obtained from medical imaging equipment according to the DICOM standard. This free DICOM viewer is used by healthcare professionals, researchers and patients.

If you are new to I-one, it is recommended to read this page to understand the main elements of the interface.

The tutorials are organized by topics and can be read independently.
