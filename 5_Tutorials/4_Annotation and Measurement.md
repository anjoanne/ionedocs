# Annotation and Measurement



This panel lets you display the contents of a DICOM SEG file superimposed on the image. It also lets you modify the transparency of specific regions (label defined by a color).

DICOM SEG can be generated by AI frameworks to represent the results of segmentation algorithms applied to medical images.

How to display DICOM SEG
In order to display the DICOM SEG regions in overlay on the image, follow these steps (see in the image below):

Open the DICOM series with a link to a DICOM SEG object. This link is visible by the segmentation icon  in the lower right-hand corner of the thumbnail.
Once the image is displayed, you can click on  of the vertical button  to show the Segmentation panel on the right side of the viewer.
A DICOM SEG file is represented by a selected item in the combo box and its list of regions below. By default, all DICOM SEG files linked to an image are displayed.
Select one or several regions to display for the selected DICOM SEG (3). Several regions are grouped together when they share the same first name. Note: the parent node must be selected to display the child regions.
