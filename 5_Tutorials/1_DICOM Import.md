How to import DICOM files
I-one Raphaview can open DICOM files from various ways and sources: drag and drop, local device, DICOM ZIP, DICOM CD/DVD, DICOM Query/Retrieve, and from commands locally or remotely.

 Note
An popup error message is displayed when DICOM files cannot be read (from v4.3.0) or when a network error occurs. In the latter case a message asking to download again the missing files.

From the system file explorer
Drag and drop
Files or folders selected from the system file explorer can be opened by dragging and dropping into the central area of Raphaview.

Empty central panel: Any files than ca be open by one of the viewers (e.g. standard images such as TIFF, PNG, JPEG…)
DICOM Explorer and DICOM viewers (SR, AU, MPR, 2D and 3D) in the central panel: Only DICOM files. Opens the default viewer according to the files.

Dicom files can be opened by double-clicking them from the system file explorer.
